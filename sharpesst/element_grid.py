# This element_grid class builds on coord_grid to specify a grid of basis or detector 
# elements (e.g., the spatial response functions of an imaging detector, including 
# their pixel boxes and PSF). It is the exemplar class for the source and detector 
# objects used by get_sparse_response_matrix. 
# The primary methods of these objects are as follows:
#    elements: Returns the properties of the element(s) at address i. 
#              When called as [elms,vals,pnts] = some_element_grid.elements(i),
#              must return the following:
#                  pnts: The coordinate points at which the these elements are non-zero,
#                        in the element_grid's coordinate frame. Dimensions should be 
#                        npts by ndim, where ndim is the dimensionality of the
#                        source coordinate system.
#                  vals: The values of the elements' 'basis' function(s) at 
#                        those coordinates. Dimensions are npts.
#                  elms: Indices of the element(s) corresponding to each of those 
#                        point/value pairs. Most often these will all be the same as i,
#                        but they don't have to be. Dimensions are npts.
#    response: Returns the response of the elements to a delta function source at a given
#              point in the element_grid's coordinate frame. When called as
#              [vals,elms] = detector.response(point), must return the following:
#                  elms: The indices of every element in the grid which has a non-zero
#                        response to a delta function source at the given point. 
#                  vals: The values of each of those responses. Same dimensions as elms.
#
# The objects also have the following attributes which are intended for external use:
#    coords: Information about the coordinate system of the output of elements and
#            the input to response. Implemented as an instance of coordgrid.
#    nelm:   The number of elements in the element_grid, as well as the number
#            of unique element id/indices.
#    nadr:   The number of element addresses in the element grid. These are
#            how the elements are accessed via the elements method. In
#            basic use these will be the same as the element indices, 
#            but there are use cases where other addressing modes are
#            desired. The addresses are generally expected to be positive integers.
# Elements are addressed by a single index apiece, but
# this is trivial to multiplex under the hood using, for instance, 
# i = i0*nj*nk+j0*nk+k0. Numpy's ravel_index, unravel_multi_index, and 
# flatten functions provide exactly this functionality. The intention of this class
# is to implement the functionalite needed by get_sparse_response_matrix for typical
# detector arrays e.g., 2D imagers or 3D spectrographs, as well as for gridded arrays
# of source elements. It should be fairly powerful and extensible.

# There is an issue with rounding and floating point jitter for aligned grids that 
# share some ratios in their spacing. We add this small offset when discretizing 
# grid indices to avoid this, which is a bit of a hack...
tiny = 1.0e-4
# On a related note, there are some intrinsic issues with even nsubgrid, which
# can produce subpixel shifts in certain situations. To see why this is the case
# consider convolution by a boxcar kernel with an even width: Such kernels are
# intrinsically asymmetric... Recommend setting det_subgrid_fac to an odd 
# number over 1.

class element_grid:
    # Set up the elements. Required inputs:
    #     grid: A coord_grid.
    #     parms: Parameters or anything else used to evaluate the response function.
    #     func: The response function evaluator.
    # Optional inputs:
    #     footprint: How far away from the input point to evaluate the response functions, 
    #                in grid points. Default: at least 21 points.
    #     stencil_thold: In addition to the footprint, a stencil is computed to
    #                    determine which grid points to use evaluate around the input point.
    #                    An initial check of the response function (with evaluation point
    #                    at the origin) is made, and points falling below this threshold are
    #                    omitted. Would probably be better to check the stencil for every
    #                    element's location, although that would be slower... Default: .0005
    #     nsubgrid: To take into accound subgrid-scale effects, evaluate the response/basis functions.
    #               at this multiple of the grid scale. Default: 3
    #     thold: Final threshold for keeping points when evaluating the response/basis functions.
    #            Default: 0.005.
