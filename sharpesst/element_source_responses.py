# Generate the sparse response matrix for the general linear forward problem,
# mediated by a pair of coordinate systems and a coordinate transform.
# Has the following arguments:
#
#     source:    An object which defines a set of indexed source, or basis,
#                elements. The element_grid class is the examplar for these objects.
#                They must implement an elements method as well as
#                nelm, nadr, and coords attributes with usage consistent with their
#                definitions in element_grid.
#     detector:  An object which defines a set of detector elements. The element_grid class
#                is the exemplar for these objects. They must implement a response method
#                as well as nelm and coords attributes with usage consistent with their
#                definitions in element_grid.
#     transform: A function which returns an object that maps points in the source
#                coordinate system to the detector coordinate system. This coordinate 
#                transform does not need to be reversible (e.g., the source system 
#                can be 3D and the detector system can be 2D) -- only the forward 
#                direction must be well defined. Naturally, this may result in a 
#                singular response matrix. Transform must be callable with the
#                following syntax:
#                    transformer = transform(source.coords,detector.coords)
#                The transformer object it returns must be callable with the
#                following syntax:
#                    pts_det_frame = transformer(pts_src_frame)
#                where pts_det_frame are pts_src_frame transformed from
#                the source frame to the detector frame
# There is a close mathematical relationship between source and detector
# elements -- almost all of their implementation code in element_grid is
# shared, and if they're swapped in the call to this routine, the result
# should merely be the transpose of the response matrix (untested).
