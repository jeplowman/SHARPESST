# This implements the notion of a grid of coordinate points that are meant to be indexed by integers.
# The basic class includes implementation for an affine (linear transformation) grid, but more general
# coordinate systems will not be hard to extend. The transformation from the indices into the coordinate
# points here should be reversible or the inds and flatinds methods will not work.
class coord_grid:
    # Set up the grid. Inputs:
    #    dims: The dimensions of the source grid, a 1-D array containing [nx0,nx1,...]
    #    origin: The location of the center of the [0,0,...] pixel in the grid
    #    fwd: The information needed to define the forward transformation (i.e., from 
    #         indices to coordinates), in addition to the origin. For the affine 
    #         transformation, this is an nd by nd matrix, where nd is the number of dimensions.
    #    inv: The information needed to define the inverse transformation (i.e., from
    #         coordinates to indices). Optional -- For the base (affine) implementation, this is
    #         computed from fwd using np.linalg.inv.
    #    frame: Information about the coordinate frame. Not used by the coord_grid itself, but
    #           may be used by other routines that want to transform between grids.

    # and matrix operations interact. Because coords returns coordinates reference to the
