# This is a minimal implementation of the coordinate transform used by get_sparse_response_matrix.
# All it does is compare the 'names' attributes of the input coords to that of the output coords.
# This works for identical coordinates, rearrangements, and downprojections, but anything
# more complex will get zeroed out. In terms of the necessary pieces for instantiating
# and applying it, though, everything should work the same from the outside and it can be 
# subclassed to add the features for any desired transformation. Note that
# these coordinate transforms might NOT be invertible in general (e.g., projection)
# unlike the transforms in the coord_grid class.
